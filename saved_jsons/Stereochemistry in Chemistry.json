        {
            "question": "What is stereochemistry?",
            "answer": "Stereochemistry is the study of the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in molecules and the effect of this arrangement on chemical reactions."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a stereoisomer?",
            "answer": "Stereoisomers are compounds with the same molecular formula and connectivity but different spatial arrangements of atoms."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a chiral molecule?",
            "answer": "A chiral molecule is a molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image and has at least one chiral center."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is an enantiomer?",
            "answer": "Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is chirality?",
            "answer": "Chirality is a geometric property of a molecule resulting from its inability to be superimposed on its mirror image."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a chiral center?",
            "answer": "A chiral center is an atom in a molecule that is bonded to four different atoms or groups, leading to chirality."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a meso compound?",
            "answer": "A meso compound is a molecule with chiral centers that also has an internal plane of symmetry, making it optically inactive."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is optical activity?",
            "answer": "Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light."
